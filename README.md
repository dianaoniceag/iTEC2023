Section: Mobile Development

the link to our project:  https://x.thunkable.com/copy/b25c715b336ff421225e529e3df4db37

To test our app & see the code inside you need to set up a Thunkable account: https://thunkable.com/#/

Then paste the link of the project. It should be duplicated in your account.
You can see the code inside by looking at the "Blocks" section.
In the "Design" section, on the left bar, underneath "Designer" there are the "Assets" and "Settings" fields. You can see the media used, as well as the 
Firebase details right there.

To test our app, once logged in and having the project duplicated, you can either:
1.Click "Web Preview"
2.Live test on device. You'll need to download the 'Thunkable' app and put the code in.

Thank you so much and hope you'll enjoy our app! :)
